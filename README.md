# Genetic algorithm for prisoners' dilemma simulation 

## Main features

Based on perceptrons that take in past history of play and corresponding results as inputs. This corresponds to the assumption of common knowledge. Players make decision at each round without knowledge of opponent's current play, this corresponds to the simultaneous nature of games.

Each node $node_i$ performs the operation
\[

\text{output}_i = \sum w_i x_i - b_i

\]

where $w_i$ and $b_i$ are the respective weights and biases
